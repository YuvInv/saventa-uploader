## Next Up

### 2. Allow Optional Contacts ([#11](https://github.com/YuvInv/sevanta-uploader/issues/11)) - Priority: High
- Currently, if contact columns are mapped, we might be enforcing valid contact data.
- **Requirement:** If contact fields are empty in the CSV for a row, simpler allow the company upload without creating a contact.
- Don't fail validation just because contact name is missing if the user didn't intend to add one.

### 3. Support Multiple Contacts per Company ([#12](https://github.com/YuvInv/sevanta-uploader/issues/12)) - Priority: High
- **Problem:** Current row-based CSV structure implies 1 contact per row/company.
- **Requirement:** Allow uploading multiple contacts for the same company.
- **Proposed Solution:** 
  - Allow multiple rows with the same `CompanyName`. 
  - The first row creates/updates the company.
  - Subsequent rows with the same `CompanyName` add additional contacts to that existing deal.

### 2. Dealigence Integration ([#2](https://github.com/YuvInv/sevanta-uploader/issues/2)) - Priority: Medium
Import companies directly from Dealigence platform.

**Approach:**
- Content script for `https://app.dealigence.com/*`
- "Send to Sevanta" button on company pages
- Extract: company name, description, website, founders
- Send to side panel for review before upload

**Files to create:**
- `src/content/dealigence.ts` - Content script
- `src/lib/extractors/dealigence.ts` - Data extraction
- Update `manifest.json` - Add content script config

**Notes:**
- User must be logged into Dealigence
- Need to analyze DOM structure of target pages
- Handle gracefully if page structure changes

---

### 3. IVC Integration ([#3](https://github.com/YuvInv/sevanta-uploader/issues/3)) - Priority: Medium
Import companies directly from IVC (Israel Venture Capital) database.

**Approach:**
- Content script for `https://www.ivc-online.com/*`
- "Send to Sevanta" button on company profiles
- Map IVC fields to Sevanta CRM fields

**Files to create:**
- `src/content/ivc.ts` - Content script
- `src/lib/extractors/ivc.ts` - Data extraction
- Update `manifest.json` - Add content script config

**Notes:**
- User must be logged into IVC
- Need to analyze DOM structure of target pages
- Handle gracefully if page structure changes

---

### 4. GitHub CI/CD for Build & Publish ([#4](https://github.com/YuvInv/sevanta-uploader/issues/4)) - Priority: Low
Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish the extension.

---

### 5. Additional Enhancements - Priority: Low
- Progress bar during CSV upload
- Error handling improvements
- Changing extension icon to VC logo

Automatically crawl news sites (Ctech, Geektime) to:
- Update existing companies with new funding rounds
- Add new companies with AI-generated summaries
- Match screening meeting summary format

---

### 7. AI Features: Company Enrichment ([#6](https://github.com/YuvInv/sevanta-uploader/issues/6)) - Priority: Low
Integrate with Perplexity (or similar) for:

- AI-driven CRM updates for outdated/missing data
- User-controlled review and acceptance of changes
